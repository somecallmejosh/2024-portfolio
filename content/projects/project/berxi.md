## Project Overview at Berxi.com

As the principal design engineer at Berxi.com, a Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance startup, I led the revamp of the website and insurance application's user interface, introducing a custom design system. This initiative aimed to improve usability, accessibility, and brand cohesion, addressing the needs of users, the business, and the development team.

## Challenges and Solutions

## Balancing User Expectations, Business Objectives, and Developer Experience

- **Challenge**: The main challenge was creating a design system that met user expectations, supported business scalability, and was developer-friendly.
- **Solution**: I developed a design system using Tailwind CSS and Vue.js, emphasizing flexibility, scalability, and accessibility. This ensured the system could grow with the business and be easily adopted by developers.

## Innovative Design System and Technology Stack Selection

- **Challenge**: Selecting a technology stack that enhanced developer productivity and aligned with the project's goals was critical.
- **Solution**: After thorough evaluation, I chose technologies that emphasized ease of use, comprehensive documentation, and superior developer experience, fostering an innovative development environment.
Collaboration Across Teams

- **Challenge**: Ensuring a cohesive user experience while integrating marketing strategies and backend functionalities.
- **Solution**: Worked closely with design, UX, and marketing teams for a unified brand experience, and collaborated with backend developers for smooth integration of the design system.

## User Data Tracking

- **Challenge**: Needed to track user data without causing performance issues or conflicts.
- **Solution**: Collaborated with UX, product, and marketing to set up tracking and reporting that provided valuable data for continuous improvement without impacting site performance.
Content Management and Marketing Campaigns

- **Challenge**: The content and marketing teams required solutions to manage content and track the effectiveness of print marketing campaigns without heavy dependency on engineering.
- **Solution**: Implemented systems that allowed content and marketing teams to manage, plan, and review content and manage vanity URLs for marketing campaigns, enhancing their independence and effectiveness.

## UI Component Library Creation

- **Challenge**: Ensuring UI consistency and advancing web accessibility initiatives.
- **Solution**: Created a UI component library that standardized design elements, fostering confidence among developers and speeding up the development process.
